# hello-world
My first!
Hi!  My name is Bryan Morehouse and I work as a sales and project manager for a public safety software company.  I never imagined I would be interested in programming but the more I work with our programmers and customers, the more I am interested.  I believe in challenging yourself to always learn something new and to make improvements in your life.  So here I go...time to learn some programming!
